  <h2> internships </h2>

  <p> I've been fortunate enough to be in the co-op program at Waterloo, which means I'll be 
    graduating in 5 years with 6 internship opportunites. I've learned a lot in my time at all
     these companies, both technically and personally! </p>

  <h2> freelance / contracting </h2>

  <p> I've tried my hand at contracting only once, and it was a great learning experience for me! 
    Working full-remote was also really fun and led to an understanding that communication is 
    crucial in general, regardless of remote or in-person work. </p>
