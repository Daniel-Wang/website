  <h2> about me </h2>

  <p> I am a 3B computer science student at Waterloo. 1st engineer at <a href="https://blockeq.com">BlockEQ</a> (acquired by Coinsquare for 12M).</p>
  <p> I was a Software Engineering Intern on the Google Cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms/">KMS</a> team, working on secure cryptographic key management for Cloud. </p>
  <p> I had the pleasure to serve as the Vice-Chair of the <a href="https://www.uwccf.com/">Chinese Christian Fellowship</a> at Waterloo, Winter 2019. </p>
  <p> If I'm not in the MC lab or CSC, you can find me out biking the trails and enjoying the fresh air. </p>

  <h2> interests </h2>

  <p> I love to build. I love to think critically in unconventional ways. I care about our privacy and security as humans in a technological world. </p>

  <h2> projects </h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li> I tried to build an encrypted cloud FUSE filesystem in Rust in Summer 2019. </li>

    <li> I love the IndieHackers <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">website</a>, so I wrote a native IndieHackers <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Wang/IndieHackersReader">reader</a> for Android. It got shutdown for copyright issues on the Play store :(</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> hackathons </h2>
  <p> I did a lot of <a href="https://devpost.com/Daniel-Wang">hackathons</a> in 1st year, 
    and a few in 2nd year, less in third year. Hackathons are great for several reasons, including: 
    free food and swag, travel, meeting smart people, networking with companies. 
    They are great ways to force yourself to work on projects if you're having an unproductive streak. </p>
