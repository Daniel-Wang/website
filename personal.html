  <h2> what i believe </h2>

  <p>I am a Christian! </p>
  <p>
    My personal conviction would be that all would come to know the Gospel: Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah
    of the Jewish scriptures and that his prophesied death and resurrection mean that he was indeed the Son of
    God, who he claimed to be. The sins of mankind were judged on his dying body, and in believing
    that Jesus is Lord, we can partake in eternal life in heaven, because the punishment of our sins
    was taken by Jesus' sacrifice. Else, our sins will be judged at face value, and we will
    receive the just outcome of sin, which is eternal suffering in Hell.
  </p>

  <p>This may seem like a load of religious gibberish, but this is like reading the 
    abstract of a 100 page research paper. There are thousands of years of context and history that
    come before Jesus. Every year, archeologists dig up more and more artifacts of Ancient Israel.
    The age of the earliest manuscripts and the amount of internal consistency and accuracy of the Bible 
    put any similarly dated texts to great shame.
